Looking at the app, I like the improvements with the calendar. 

I¡¯d like to see the following changes:

Change the word ¡°gravida¡± to ¡°number of pregnancies¡± (in the comments, change gravida to you)

Medical history (these should all be background settings that doesn¡¯t come up after completed the first time unless someone goes into settings and change them)

If someone select hypertension or diabetes, then prompt them to enter blood pressure and glucose in a separate area.

Give option to set reminder for blood pressure daily and prompt patient to select the time of day for the reminder

Give option to select home blood pressure cuff or doctor office

Make spreadsheet to record blood pressure values overtime

Give option to set reminder for glucose with preset for fasting at 7am,  breakfast at 9am, lunch at 1am and dinner 7am

Make option for patient to adjust time

Record glucose values on a spreadsheet that is accessible with a button, day of the week per roll, and fasting/breakfast/lunch/dinner on column.

Also allow option to calculate averages, %highs and %lows

Create section for labs
Prompt patient to enter certain lab results: blood type (ABO, +/-), Hemoglobin, platelet, AST, ALT, Creatinine, Urine protein, first trimester down syndrome screen, second trimester down syndrome screen, NIPT, Amniocentesis, sickle cell screen, cystic fibrosis screen, HIV, syphilis (RPR) Hepatitis B/C, gestational diabetes screen, GBS result.
Record date/time stamp for result.
Prompt should come up based on current gestational age as long as lab values are missing

Create summary report for labs
On day of doctor visit prompt a list of questions and discussion items

Create a question bank with commonly asked questions that patient can select to include in the discussions for the visit
Some questions should be gestational age specific (I¡¯ll make a list later for this)

Allow patient to add to the list of questions and concerns

Other features to consider later:
Nutrition and diet section maybe with links to meal plans
Exercise and activity section with links to exercise regimens and tracker
Social media section to connect with others using the app for motivation and support
 

 

We should also meet at some point to talk about these changes. I think in person is better, to talk about the app design
